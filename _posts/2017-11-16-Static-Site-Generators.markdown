## What do you think of static site generators?
1. What type of projects are they suitable for?

1. The SSG, increases the difficulty yet another step when first creating your templates, however beyond that stage the SSG allows you to divide and assemble html pages with relative ease. So suitable projects for using SSG would be anything where primarily the main content is what differs from page to page whilst the main layout remains the same, such as newsletters and e-mail services. If not for the sheer size of sites like youtube and the time it would take to rebuild after any change it would also be a suitable candidate.
