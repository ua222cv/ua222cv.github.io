## What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

The Open Graph Protocol is designed to control the layout of shared links on social media. By adding a few meta tags to the head of your website you can instruct sites such as facebook and twitter how to present your site after it has been shared on their site.
I've added an image, type, URL and short descrition of this site and made sure they show up properly when sharing the site on facebook.
