Since the task was issued english I'll answer it in english as well.

## What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
1. Compare to regular CSS
2. Which techniques did you use?
3. Pros and cons?

* Compared to regular CSS using a pre-processor enables us to organize the code in a more comfortable manner, using variables, functions and referencing them all the way through your style files. Dividing the SCSS files into several smaller files such as layout and base makes the individual files much easier to navigate.
* As I've used the template for Minima I've used the variables already set up and briefly created a file _header.scss and the idea to divide the _layout.scss file even further, however I ultimatley decided not to.
* Unless properly organized it will be a lot harder to work with and it is a bit harder to get into that pure CSS but after that I'm only seeing the benefits in using pre-processors. Functions, variables and dividing the files for a more organized and streamlined development process
